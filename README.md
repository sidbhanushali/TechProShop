## Run This App Locally

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```

npm install

cd frontend

npm install



```

### ES Modules in Node

ECMAScript Modules are used in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```

NODE_ENV = development

PORT = 5000

MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri

JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'

PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id



```

### Run

```

# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)

npm run dev



# Run backend only

npm run server



```

## Build & Deploy

```

# Create frontend prod build

cd frontend

npm run build



```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```

# Import data

npm run data:import



# Destroy data
